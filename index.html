								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personal.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am a theoretical physicist working in the field of Condensed matter physics. I work in
									<a href="https://www.physastro.iastate.edu/people/rebecca-flint">Rebecca Flint's</a> theory group at Iowa State University in the United States. </p>

								<p> I completed my Masters degree from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER)
									in 2015 in India. Then I came to Iowa State University for my PhD the same year. I am currently a final year student here continuing
									under the supervision of Dr. Rebecca Flint. I primarily work in the area of frustrated magnetism, particularly looking for spin liquids
									on novel lattices. </p>
								<p>I am also an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enthusiast. I plan to leverage my 8+ years of experience in the quantitative sciences to
									make a career in Data Science. Since the past 2 years, I have engaged myself in several projects alongside my research to achieve the same. </p>

								<h3>Graduate Research</h3>
								<p>Primarily, I look for ways to stabilize a particular phase of spin systems known in the literature as
									'spin liquids'. This includes the application of a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to
									predict certain desirable properties in spin systems. Analytical techniques include mean-field, linear and
									interacting spin-waves and quantum field theory in general. Numerical techniques entail Classical Monte Carlo,
									iterative minimization, variational Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization. We enjoy significant collaboration
									with the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign for the numerical analysis. More recently, I have focused on applying magnetic field
									to novel lattices and describe the phenomenon that ensues. For a list of my publications and associated citations,
									check out my google scholar page <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meT8YV4AAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>.</p>

								<h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>

								<ol>

									<li><h4>Thesis</h4></li>
								<p>My thesis work was done under the supervision of <a href="http://www.niser.ac.in/~ravi/index.html">Dr. V. Ravi Chandra</a> at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER). My first publication is partially based
									on this work along with a few subsequent years of analysis. We investigate the nature of the low energy spectrum of the Pyrochlore lattice with spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic interaction using exact
									diagonalization techniques. We study a section of the lattice in the [111] direction and analyze the Hamiltonian of the breathing pyrochlore system with two coupling constants
									J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>2</sub> for tetrahedra of different orientations and investigate the evolution of the system from the limit of disconnected tetrahedra (J<sub>2</sub> = 0) to a correlated state at J<sub>1</sub> = J<sub>2</sub>.
								 We evaluate the low energy spectrum and several multi-spin correlations for a system size of upto 36 sites. The model shows a fast decay of spin correlations and we confirm the presence
								 of several singlet excitations below the lowest magnetic excitation. Negligible chirality correlations were seen for the system size considered. While a entanglement spectrum analysis
							 combined with the dimer-dimer correlations found the ground state entanglement to be dominated by the triplet sector of the tetrahedron for J<sub>1</sub> = J<sub>2</sub>. The details can be found in the paper
							 <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.144407">here</a>.</p>

							 <p>The codes were all written in C++ and took advantage of the local cluster computing services via parallel computation. This involved applying linear algebra operations on matrix sizes of the order (2<super>30</super> x 2<super>30</super>)</p>

							 <li><h4>Summer projects</h4></li>
							 <p>The following is a list of projects done over the summers of some of the academic years at NISER.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Extra Dirac points in a monolayer graphene sample with a superlattice and an
										external magnetic field (Summer 2014)</b></li>
									<p>The electronic properties of a monolayer graphene sample is discussed. The massless fermionic
										behaviour of electrons is subsequently deduced using a Dirac-like equation in the vicinity of the
										dirac points. Then the stationary states in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is resolved
										giving an exact analytic solution. With a motivation to further explore the properties of graphene,
										we head towards introducing a superlattice on top of graphene and explore the subsequent results.</p>

										<li><b>Basics of Inflation model in Cosmology (Summer 2013)</b></li>
										<p>Apart from the large scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe that one usually talks of, there
											are certain inhomogeneities that are observable in smaller scales as well in scales much larger than the
											observable patch of the universe which can be properly explained by the so called inflationary theory.
											We analysed the Planck data of the cosmic microwave background radiation and used statistical
											tools like three point correlation functions, bispectrum etc. to characterize such inhomogeneities.</p>

											<li><b>Coulomb Problem Mapped into the Harmonic oscillator and a Discussion on Stark Effect (Summer 2012).</b></li>
											<p>The motivation for this project comes from the geometric intuition that since the classical orbits of the bound Kepler problem
												and the harmonic oscillator are ellipses then there should exist a transformation between these two problems. We have also dealt
												with stark effect mainly its classical view and its relation to quantum mechanics.</p>


									<li><b>Understanding the mechanics of the Domino effect (Summer 2011).</b></li>
									<p>The various aspects of mechanics of a row of falling dominoes is analyzed in this project. Simple Newtonian mechanics has been
										employed to study this problem. It was a reading project based on this <a href="https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1119/1.3406154">paper</a>.
									This paper attempts to show that a long row of falling dominoes eventually attains a constant asymptotic velocity depending on the various
									constraints involved(friction coefficient).</p>

						<!-- About -->
						<article id="Projects">
							<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wordcloud.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This section is a compilation of the several Data Science projects that I have done over the years. It includes indepndent projects
							as well as the ones done as part of a course work. The projects are not shown in chronological order.</p>
							<ol>
								<li><h3>Segmentation of Los Angeles neighborhoods based on restaurant types/densities</h3></li>
								<span class = "float-left"><img src="images/folium_map.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Coursera_Capstone">IBM Capstone</a></p>
								<p>As part of the capstone project for the IBM professsional certificate, I did an unsupervised learning problem.
									The idea of the project is to explore restaurants in Los Angeles and predict optimal locations for new restaurant setups.
									For leveraging location data, I use Folium for producing maps indicating venue locations. For the learning part,
									I use a K-means clustering for segmenting the various neighborhoods according to restaurant densities, types or frequency
									of occurrence. Further details are in the github link.</p>

									<li><h3>Credit Card Customer Segmentation</h3></li>
									<span class = "float-left"><img src="images/PCA.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Customer-Segmentation-with-Unsupervised-Learning">Customer Segmentation</a></p>
									<p>This deals with an unsupervised learning problem in finance. It leverages credit info. of several thousand customers obtained from
										Kaggle to segment them into groups with certain characteristics. A KMeans Clustering method is employed to achieve the same. We also use dimensionality
										reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to reduce the feature space.
										 Further details are in the github link.</p>

										 <li><h3>Stocks Sentiment Analysis</h3></li>
		 								<span class = "float-left"><img src="images/negative.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
		 								<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Stock-Sentiment-Analysis">Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
		 								<p>We look at a NLP problem here related to sentiment prediction for stock markets. Several well known techniques that are commonly used in NLP for preprocessing
											the texts like stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatizing, etc were used before training various deep learning models. One interesting and quite powerful visulaization technique to learn
											about words influencing a particular sentiment is <b>WordCloud</b>. The image used above comes from one such visualization for negative stocks sentiment from our own dataset.
		 									 Further details are in the github link.</p>

											 <li><h3>Stocks Price Prediction</h3></li>
				 						 <span class = "float-left"><img src="images/stocks.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
				 						 <p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Stock-Price-Predictions/blob/main/Stock_Price_Predictions.ipynb">Stocks prediction</a></p>
				 						 <p>We look at a time-series analysis problem here with respect to stocks. It leverages a curated dataset consisting of a few popular stocks and also the popular 'SP500' index.
											  The stocks analyzed here are that of Google, Apple, AT&T, Tesla, MGM, Amazon, IBM and Boeing. The datasets not only contains the daily stock price but also the traded stock
												volumes. Several interesting observations including the effect of coronavirus pandemic were made. More details in the github link</p>

								<li><h3>Exploratory Data Analysis on a breast cancer dataset</h3></li>
								<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Breast_cancer_study-">Breast Cancer</a></p>
								<p>In this project, I analyze a breast cancer dataset with seaborn plots. Based on such an analysis, a feature selection step
									 is performed by filtering redundant correlated features along with eliminating some non-predictive features.
									 The ML models then finally take advantage of this exploratory analysis.</p>

								<li><h3>Employee Churn Prediction</h3></li>
	 							<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/Employee_churn_prediction">Churn prediction</a></p>
	 							<p>This project deals with predicting employee churn using an interactive Decision tree and a Random Forest classifier.
									As part of a guided project in coursera, we used a Decision tree and a Random Forest model to predict employee churn.
									We also made the corresponding models interactive to visualize different Decsion tree/random forest models in one go.
									We also evaluated our model using the ROCAUC curves and compared it against a logistic regression model.</p>

									<li><h3>Tensorflow Projects</h3></li>
		 							<p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/jyotisman-ds/TensorFlow_projects">TensorFlow</a></p>
		 							<p>This is a compilation of some of the deep learning projects that I worked on independently.
										This is by no means an exhaustive list. Its mostly for demonstration of the skills that I have acquired over the years
										as a learner and an enthusiast. The image classifiers below are also deployed to local browsers using Tensorflow.js </p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Beans Classifier</b></li>
											<img alt="" class="percent-30 float-left" width = "100%" height = "100%" src="images/bean_rust.png"/>
												<p>This model learns the Beans images dataset from tensorflow datasets. The images are first processed through an
													augmentation pipeline before being fed into training. This is all done using a tf.data pipeline for faster training.
													The trained model can take a picture of a bean leaf and predict whether it belongs to one of the two
													diseased categories - bean_rust or angular leaf spot or if its healthy.</p>
											<li><b>Dog Breed Classifier</b></li>
											<span class = "float-left"><img src="images/saint_bernard.png" width = "100%" height = "100%" alt="" /></span>
											<p>This model uses the stanford_dogs dataset available from tensorflow datasets to train a dog classifier. Like the Beans classifier,
												the images are again part of a tf.data training pipeline. Since this is a complicated dataset, we use transfer
												learning to train our model here. I use the InceptionV3 model with the default 'imagenet' weights. Inception is a highly
												optimized model for image classification benchmarked against the famous imagenet dataset. I set the last few layers of
												the model to be trainable for my purposes.</p>
												<li><b>Sentiment Classifier</b></li>
												<p>This model learns the yelp_polarity_reviews dataset from tensorflow datasets. This is a simple text classifier with
													1D convolutional and global average pooling layers. It's a binary classifier with review polarities labelled as a
													negative '0' label and a positive '1' label. The common preprocessing steps for this text dataset was taken care of by
													the TextVectorization layer from tensorflow which is inherited from keras.layers class. Apart from vectorizing each text
													 with integer tokens, this layer also limits the max_length of the reviews and also pads them whenever needed.</p>
													<!-- width = "50" height = "400" -->
												</ul>

													<li><h3>Recommendation Systems</h3></li>
													<p>This was done as part of the IBM Data Science professional certificate. A simple movie recommendation engine was created using just python and pandas.
												 	Two techniques namely content-based and collborative filtering were employed. As the name suggests, content-based filtering attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of
													an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects.
													On the other hand, collaborative filtering attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input user and then recommends items
													that they have liked to the input.  Pearson correlation was used to find similar users.</p>

													<li><h3>Deployment of Machine Learning models</h3></li>
													<p>This is an exhaustive course offered by Udemy on model deployment. The course not only introduces beginner and advanced model deployment tools but also goes
													through identifying and mitigating challenges of putting models in production. Using the <a href="https://github.com/trainindata/deploying-machine-learning-models">course repository</a> on GitHub, we learn how to first
												prepare production ready code in python, test it (pytest), version it, add logging and most importantly ensuring its reproducibility. Once the model package is built we serve it using a multitude of tools. We can serve it
											either via a REST API using <b>Flask</b>, or as a 'Platform as a service (PaaS)' using <b>Heroku</b>, or as a 'Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)' using amazon web services (<b>AWS</b>). In order to
										automate the deployment steps, we also used <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> that takes care of the multiple error prone steps that typically occur during custom deployment. We also learnt how to containerize the running
									of apps using <b>Docker</b> locally as well as through CircleCI.</p>
